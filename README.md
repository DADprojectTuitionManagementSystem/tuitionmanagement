## 1.0 Introduction

  ### 1.1 Project Overview
  Tuition Management System helps tutors and students manage tuition classes in organizing and managing tuition related data. The system provides key features such as class scheduling, schedule status, student enrollment, attendance tracking and payment management. Our team focuses on automating manual processes like registration, fee tracking, students attendance tracking and timetable coordination. The system aims to reduces administrative workload and human error. 

  Tutors can add easily create and update class sessions, update class time, class status and access list of students. Students can browse available classes, register new classes, display tuition fees and proceed to payment. 

  ### 1.2 Commercial Value / Third-Party Integration
The Tuition Management System has a strong commercial potential especially for private tutors, freelance educator and tuition centers as the system can cater from small to big audience. The system seek a streamlined digital solution in managing daily operation usually done by human. This system can be offered as a software-as-a-services (SaaS) platform, targeting small to medium tuition educators.

# 3. Backend Application

### 3.1 Technology Stack

The backend of this tuition management system is built using a combination of powerful technologies to ensure scalability, maintainability and performance. The Tuition Management System is developed using Spring Boot, a Java-based framework that simplifies the development of web application. Eclipse IDE is used as development environment and providing tools for efficient coding. The system uses MySQL database to store and manage data.

| Component        | Technology           |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Language          | Java                |
| IDE               | Eclipse              |
| Framework         | Spring Boot          |
| Database          | MySQL                |


### 3.2 API Documentation

#### 3.2.1 Endpoints List

| Endpoint             | Method | Description                  |
|----------------------|--------|------------------------------|
| `/api/users`         | GET    | List all users               |
| `/api/users/:id`     | GET    | Get user by ID               |
| `/api/classes`       | GET    | Get all classes              |
| `/api/classes`       | POST   | Create a new class           |
| `/api/payments`      | POST   | Make a payment               |
| `/api/login`         | POST   | Login and receive token      |

#### 3.2.2 Request Format

Example (POST `/api/classes`):
json
{
  "subject": "Math",
  "day": "Monday",
  "start_time": "10:00",
  "end_time": "11:30",
  "tutor_id": 2
}

### 3.2.3 Example Success

### 3.2.4 Security Measure
<img width="1100" height="553" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2572cc0-1888-428e-9fcf-4180af16db46" />

Security measures implemented:

Disabled CSRF protection → because the backend is likely a stateless REST API using tokens (e.g., JWT), so CSRF isn’t needed.

Allowed public access (permitAll) to login pages, dashboards, API endpoints for auth/classes/payments, and static resources (CSS, JS, images) → so the frontend can load properly and users can access login features without being blocked.

Disabled Spring’s default form login and HTTP Basic auth → because the app uses a custom frontend login page and handles authentication via its own API.

Why:

The backend serves as an API for a separate frontend rather than a traditional server-rendered app.

Token-based authentication makes CSRF protection and built-in login mechanisms unnecessary.

Public access is needed for initial pages and resources, while actual data protection would be handled by custom API security (e.g., JWT).




## 5.0 Database Design
### 5.1 ERD diagram
The ERD below represents the core structure of the tuition management system's database. It includes four main entities:

- *User*: Stores all users of the system (students and tutors). The role field distinguishes their function, either STUDENT or TUTOR.
- *Class Entity*: Represents a tuition class, including its subject, schedule and the tutor assigned to each class.
- *Class Entity Student IDs*: A bridge table that links students to the classes they are enrolled in, enabling a many-to-many relationship.
- *Payment*: Records all payment transactions made by students for tuition classes.


The diagram helps visualize how users, classes and payments are related, ensuring the system is well-structured, relational, and scalable.

### 6.2 Data Validation Rules

This section outlines the key validation rules implemented across both the **Student** and **Tutor** applications. These rules ensure user inputs are complete, correct, and compatible with backend requirements.

#### Student App Validation
