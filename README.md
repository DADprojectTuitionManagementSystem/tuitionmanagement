## 1.0 Introduction

  ### 1.1 Project Overview
  Tuition Management System helps tutors and students manage tuition classes in organizing and managing tuition related data. The system provides key features such as class scheduling, schedule status, student enrollment, attendance tracking and payment management. Our team focuses on automating manual processes like registration, fee tracking, students attendance tracking and timetable coordination. The system aims to reduces administrative workload and human error. 

  Tutors can add easily create and update class sessions, update class time, class status and access list of students. Students can browse available classes, register new classes, display tuition fees and proceed to payment. 

  ### 1.2 Commercial Value / Third-Party Integration
The Tuition Management System has a strong commercial potential especially for private tutors, freelance educator and tuition centers as the system can cater from small to big audience. The system seek a streamlined digital solution in managing daily operation usually done by human. This system can be offered as a software-as-a-services (SaaS) platform, targeting small to medium tuition educators.

# 3. Backend Application

### 3.1 Technology Stack

The backend of this tuition management system is built using a combination of powerful technologies to ensure scalability, maintainability and performance. The Tuition Management System is developed using Spring Boot, a Java-based framework that simplifies the development of web application. Eclipse IDE is used as development environment and providing tools for efficient coding. The system uses MySQL database to store and manage data.
